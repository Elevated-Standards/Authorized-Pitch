# The Pitch

## Authorized – Transforming Compliance Into Continuous Trust

**Imagine shrinking FedRAMP authorization from months to hours, cutting manual effort by 95%, and turning audits into a continuous, automated confidence loop.**  
That’s exactly what we’re building: a unified **Suite of solutions** that merges AI-driven analysis, continuous attestation APIs, and real-time compliance intelligence into a single, secure platform.

### Why Now
Rewriting the rules — moving from static, document-heavy audits to **capabilities-based Key Security Indicators (KSIs)**, continuous reporting, and API-driven evidence sharing.  
Our platform is designed from the ground up to meet — and exceed — those expectations, leveraging:

- **Automated Evidence Parsing & Mapping** to extract and align compliance data from documents, spreadsheets, and databases directly to FedRAMP requirements.
- **Continuous Attestation APIs** with real-time data aggregation and RBAC to stream secure, role-specific compliance updates【.
- **Integrated 3PAO tooling** for rapid attestation and seamless evidence retrieval.
- **AI anomaly detection & contextual guidance** for instant remediation advice.
- **Cryptographic integrity & access controls** to secure and verify every piece of evidence.
- **Event-driven alerts & machine-readable outputs** for automated workflows.
- **Contextual risk scoring with threat intelligence & security graph visualization**.
- **Automated remediation** through auto-patching and rolling rebuilds.
- **Dual outputs** – JSON APIs for machines, interactive dashboards for humans.
- **Developer workflow integrations** with GitHub/Jira/Slack/PagerDuty, enabling “autofix” PR.

### How It Works
1. **Ingest & Normalize:** Our secure aggregation engine connects to internal APIs, cloud configs, 3PAO tools, and logs, normalizing data into a unified schema.  
2. **Parse & Verify:** NLP-driven parsers map structured and unstructured evidence to KSIs and compliance frameworks automatically.  
3. **Sign & Secure:** JSON outputs are cryptographically signed for authenticity and integrity.  
4. **Analyze & Alert:** AI/ML models detect anomalies, score risk contextually, and trigger alerts via API/webhooks in under 2 seconds.  
5. **Visualize & Act:** Trust Center dashboards show stoplight charts, trends, and security graphs in real-time.  
6. **Continuously Attest:** Automated reporting delivers machine-readable and human-friendly outputs to agencies — no request hoops, no point-in-time gaps.

### Market Opportunity
- **Faster Time-to-ATO:** Compressing low-level authorizations into weeks or hours opens the door for startups and SMBs previously locked out of federal markets.  
- **Cost Savings:** Eliminating re-baselining and redundant documentation can save enterprises hundreds of thousands annually.  
- **Competitive Differentiator:** Early adopters of continuous attestation will stand out in the federal procurement ecosystem.

### Why Us
We’re not just aligning with FedRAMP’s future — we’re building the tools that make it possible today. Our architecture meets the Minimum Assessment Scope Standard, supports inherited controls, and directly integrates with modern DevSecOps pipelines, making compliance a **byproduct of good engineering**, not a separate burden.
